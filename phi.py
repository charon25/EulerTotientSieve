    This works using the expression : phi(n) = n * Î£ (1 - 1 / p) for every prime p dividing n
    This can be rewritten as phi(n) = n * Î£ (p - 1) / p

    Then, instead of computing "n by n", we compute "p by p" : loop through every number n and if it is prime, loop through every multiple k*n (k > 1 and k*n < LIMIT) and multiply the sieve value by (n - 1) / n.
    To avoid dealing with float numbers, we int divide sieve[k*n] by n (as it is a multiple), and then multiply by (n - 1).
